# ShopCycle
> Repetition makes perfect ~DeAndre Hopkins

ShopCycle is a Flutter application that streamlines the management of recurring shopping lists. The app leverages Firebase for both its authentication system and database, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience.

## Authorization Screen
Upon launching the app, users are greeted with the option to log in or sign up. After registration, a verification link is sent to the user's email to confirm their account. Once the account is created (or the user logs in), they are directed to the screen displaying their saved shopping lists.

## Saved Shopping Lists Screen
In the Saved Shopping Lists screen, users can easily browse through their stored lists and view their contents. Once a list is opened, users have the option to edit or delete it. Additionally, the app allows users to transfer any saved list directly to their current shopping list with a single click.

## Current Shopping List Screen
The Current Shopping List screen provides users with access to their active list. Users can add new items to the list as needed. Items that have been checked off are automatically struck through. The entire list can be cleared with a single click for convenience.
